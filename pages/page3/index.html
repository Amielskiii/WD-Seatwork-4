            <h1>Takumi Fujiwara</h1>
            <p>Driver of AE86</p>
            <p>( 藤原 拓海 ) Fujiwara Takumi, known as Tak. He acts as the delivery boy for his father's tofu business, driving his father's Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86) up to the top of the mountain every morning to deliver tofu to the hotels for the day. After defeating Keisuke Takahashi in an impromptu battle he was nicknamed the "White Ghost of Akina" and began racing on his own, occasionally representing the Akina SpeedStars in battle. He was eventually invited to join Project D as their downhill ace. "That's my dream, Natsuki. To become the best driver the world's ever seen."</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">Fujiwara zone</h3>
                <p class="feature-description">A near-supernatural ability to accelerate an FR car like a 4WD, an ability to change the rhythm of the racing line, and an ability to surprise his opponents by learning opponents' tricks on-the-fly during a race, among others. Fujiwara Zone may also be used to explain his ability to "race without seeing", to instinctively know after driving a course once, where the turns and tricks are, and can even be used to explain his being able to perform his trademark attack where he turns his headlights off and "disappears".</p>

                <p class="feature-description">Entering a high speed corner a driver lifts his foot off the throttle to induce a mild over steer and then balances the drift through steering and throttle motions. </p>

                <p class="feature-description">This is the same technique as above except it's the exit-oriented method. The timing to drop in the tires and release them is different. Instead of using the gutter when entering the turn, it's used when exiting. This technique is better than the one above, and Takumi uses it to turn the battle around when he's desperate. </p>
